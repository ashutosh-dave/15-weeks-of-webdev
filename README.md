# 15 Weeks of Web Development üöÄ

*Somewhere between learning and re-learning.*

It's going to be an interesting journey. My current workplace requires me to write lots of PHP and jQuery, but I am curious about all the hyped-up tech, libraries, and frameworks. If I don't get to work with them, I should at least give them a shot. Learn new things as much as I can and, of course, build some cool projects around them.

### Starting from July 8, 2024.

My approach is going to be simple: get familiar with the library/framework, think of a small project, build it, and gradually increase the complexity of the projects. I am not solidifying what I will learn and what I won't. I am keeping this journey as interesting and flexible as it can be because it's a fun little challenge. Learning is the primary goal, and dealing with the FOMO of all the latest and hyped-up frameworks and libraries too. I have bought numerous courses too. I do want to finish them, or at least get some value out of them.

Good luck to me! Let's see how far I can go. üöÄ
