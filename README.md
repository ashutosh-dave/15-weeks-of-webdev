# 15-weeks-of-webdev

*somewhere between learning and re-learning*

it's going to be interesting an journey. my current workplace requires me to write lots of php and jQuery. but i am curious about all the hyped up tech, libraries, and frameworks. if i don't get to work with them, i should at least give them a shot. learn new things as much as i can. and of course build some cool projects around them.

### starting from, july 8, 2024.

my approach is going to be simple. get familiar with the library/framework. think of a small project. build it. and gradually increase the complexity of the projects. i am not solidifying what i will learn, and what i won't. i am keeping this journey as interesting and as flexible as it can be, because it's a fun lil challenge. learning is the primary goal. also, dealing with the fomo of all the latest and hyped up framework and libraries too. i have bought numerous courses too. i do want to finish them, or at least get some value out of them.

good luck to me! let's see how far i can go.
